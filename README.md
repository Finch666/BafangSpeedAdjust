# BafangSpeedAdjust

Set bike back to 25 kmph with a button, in case of an emergency (!)
Inserted a led somewhere to confirm speed setting.
Most likely you will want to turn a led off when set to 25 kmph; just to check wether it succeeded and make it unvisible.
Nb: whole unit can be placed within the frame of the bike; plenty of room in the tube that runs downwards from the saddle.
One cable that runs to the motor and another that runs to a led.
Led can be placed anywhere.
When you get home, use another unit to get your bike back to higher assist speeds
NB: When you power down the bike, on next restart the led will light up, in spite of having the bike at 25 kmph. Working on that issue!
!!! USE AT OWN RISK !!!
