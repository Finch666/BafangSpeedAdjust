# BafangSpeedAdjust

Set bike back to 25 kmph with a button, in case of an emergency (!)
Inserted a led somewhere to confirm speed setting.
Most likely you will want to turn a led off when set to 25 kmph; just to check whether it succeeded and make it invisible.
Nb: whole unit can be placed within the frame of the bike; plenty of room in the tube that runs downwards from the saddle; especially when you remove the gps unit.
One cable that runs to the motor and two others that runs to a led and a pushbutton/switch.
Led and button can be placed anywhere out of normal sight.
When you get home, use another unit to get your bike back to higher assist speeds
NB: When you power down the bike, on next restart the led will light up, in spite of having the bike at 25 kmph. Working on that issue! (or I just leave it as is)
!!! USE AT OWN RISK !!!
