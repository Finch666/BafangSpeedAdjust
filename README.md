# BafangSpeedAdjust

Set bike back to 25 kmph with a button.
Inserted a led somewhere to confirm speed setting.
Most likely you will want to turn a led off when set to 25 kmph; just to check wether it succeeded and make it unvisible.
Nb: whole unit can be placed within the frame of the bike; plenty of room in the tube that runs downwards from the saddle.
One cable that runs to the motor and another that runs to a led.
Led can be placed anywhere.
!!! USE AT OWN RISK !!!
